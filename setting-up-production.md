# Production Ready - Flutter Noobie

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

Even I have experience with React Native setting up for dev/uat/production app. It still cost me the whole day to setup flutter for dev/production ready. I think it could help everyone else to speed up the process.

So below is what I have experience with flutter setting up for deployment.
