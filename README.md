[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

I hope people who are new to flutter will find it useful. I have created this README from what I have learn from flutter. Because I love doing new stuffs. It's not for my personal learning improvment only but it also sharing with our teams and hopefully will benefit to everyone that interested with flutter and don't know where to start.

So below is what I have experience with flutter.
